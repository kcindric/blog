## Hey there :wave:,

I'm Kristijan and I'm... I'm not sure exactly what to be honest.
I'm a software developer by trade and have been for 4 years now. I **love** to code, built my own website using Adobe Dreamweaver in the early 2000's and since then didn't stop hacking stuff on my computer. 

But I also have a Master's degree in Biology and I've discovered two new cave snail species and published [a paper about that](https://hrcak.srce.hr/file/323111). How (cool || random) is that?

My way of exploring hobbies is to get really hyperfocused and go down the rabbit hole and see if it organically sticks or not. To paraphrase this, one of my hobbies is trying new hobbies :) The ones I 'maintain' and didn't drop are playing music (I play bass, guitar, keyboards and been producing my own [music](https://faunazg.bandcamp.com/)), [photography](https://www.instagram.com/bikemyday/?), cooking and a recent one which is using a vintage sewing machine to sew my own gear.

Being in nature is a non-negotiable aspect of my life. I need it to stay mentally sane and to be happy about my self. I was a caver during my college years but now I mostly spend my time in nature *above* the ground. I like bicycle touring as I find that to be the best travel speed for my mind. Multiday hikes are also my favourite because I like the simplicity of it, how your priorities change and how you can live comfortably with just the stuff in your backpack.

As of this blog, to be honest I don't expect a lot of readers, if any, but I like the idea of having my own space on the internet to express myself in words about the above-mentioned stuff. Also, it's a great exercise to learn to explain my thoughts in a non-native language.

Thanks for reading and see you out there!
